= An index of AsciiDoc syntax

Ref http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

Note: HubPress uses the **AsciiDoc** markup — not to be confused with **AsciiDoctor**.

NOTE: As of 7/20/06, the ghostium theme seems to be the only theme that is  rendering the AsciiDoc syntax in the same way as the quick reference guide.

***

Is anything else working here?

OK, things seem to better after a hard restart. But for some reason HubPress can't takde a large paste of the AsciiDoc syntax from Atom into it.

***

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles,
documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text. This
guide is a quick reference for the common AsciiDoc document and text formatting
markup.

These examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend. AsciiDoc
produces complementary output when generating PDF, EPUB, and DocBook.

Most features labeled Asciidoctor only can be made available to the legacy
AsciiDoc Python processor by using this AsciiDoc configuration file provided by
the Asciidoctor project. Paragraphs Normal view result

Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc. A paragraph is just one
or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.

Line breaks view result

Rubies are red, + Topazes are blue.

[%hardbreaks] Ruby is red. Java is black.

Literal view result

A normal paragraph.

 A sequence of lines that begin with at least one space is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text. The text is shown in a
 fixed-width font and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

Admonition view result

NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to auxiliary
information. Its purpose is determined by the label at the beginning of the
paragraph.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

WARNING: Watch out for...

CAUTION: Ensure that...

	You can also create admonition blocks. Lead paragraph view result

[.lead] This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

	The default Asciidoctor stylesheet automatically styles the first paragraph of
	the preamble as a lead paragraph. More Paragraph, Admonition and Literal Block

	Asciidoctor does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to

.AsciiDoc history **** AsciiDoc was first released in Nov 2002 by Stuart
Rackham. It was designed from the start to be a shorthand syntax for producing
professional documents like DocBook and LaTeX. ****

|Cell in column 1, row 2 |Cell in column 2, row 2 |Cell in column 3, row 2 |===

	Unless the cols attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the
	number of vertical bars on the first non-blank line inside the block
	delimiters. When a blank line follows a single line of column titles, the
	column titles row will be styled as a header row by default. Table with two
	columns, a header, and two rows of content

|Cell in column 1, row 1 |Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2 |Cell in column 2, row 2 |===

	The * in the cols attribute is the repeat operator. It means repeat the column
	specification for the remainder of columns. In this case, it means to repeat
	the default formatting across 4 columns. When the header row is not defined on
	a single line, you must use the cols attribute to set the number of columns
	and options attributes to make the first row a header. Table with three

[1] Some replacements are Unicode characters, whereas others are numeric
character references. The character references (e.g., &#34;) are used whenever
the use of the Unicode character could interfere with the AsciiDoc syntax or
confuse the renderer (i.e., the browser). It’s up to the converter to transform
the reference into something the renderer understands (something both the
manpage and PDF converter handle).

[2] Asciidoctor does not prevent you from reassigning predefined attributes.
However, it’s best to treat them as read-only unless the output format requires
the use of a different encoding scheme. These attributes are an effective tool
for decoupling content and presentation.

[3] Asciidoctor allows you to use any of the named character references (aka
named entities) defined in HTML (e.g., &euro; resolves to €). However, using
named character references can cause problems when generating non-HTML output
such as PDF because the lookup table needed to resolve these names may not be
defined. Our recommendation is avoid using named character references—​with the
exception of those defined in XML (i.e., lt, gt, amp, quot and apos). Instead,
use numeric character references (e.g., &#8364;).

[4] The Zero Width Space (ZWSP) is a code point in Unicode that shows where a
long word can be split if necessary.

[5] The word joiner (WJ) is a code point in Unicode prevents a line break at its
position. Environment attributes Attribute 	Description 	Example Value
